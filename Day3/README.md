# Python in Data Science

**Speaker**: Nikolas Theodosiou

**Prerequisites**: Trainees should be comfortable with writing simple Python code.

**Description**: In this session we will present a simple Data Science project lifecycle, using the Python programming language. That is, Python will be used in order to load, clean and explore a real-world dataset. A predictive model will be then implemented and evaluated. The examples will be presented in an interactive Google Colab Notebook, and trainees will have the opportunity to become familiar with some well-established Data Science tools and libraries, such as [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

## Slot 1 (10:00 - 11:30): Introduction to Pandas :panda_face:

During the first half of the presentation, the participants will be introduced to the Pandas library. As Pandas is an extremely useful tool for data analytics and data manipulation, we will walk through some of it's key features and functionalities.

## Slot 2 (12:00 - 13:00): Diamond Price Prediction :gem:

During the second half of the presentation, we will use the tools provided by the aforementioned libraries in order to implement an end-to-end data science task, from exploratory analysis to predictive modelling. For this, a publicly available dataset will be used.
